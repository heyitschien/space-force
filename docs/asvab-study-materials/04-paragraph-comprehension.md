## 🔴 Fundamental Reading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Identify the Main Idea

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #2196f3; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #1976d2; margin-top: 0;">🔵 Main Idea Questions</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Look for the central point the author is making. Usually found in the first or last sentence.</p>
</div>

**Example Passage:**
> An important stage of personal time management is to take control of appointments. Determined by external obligation, appointments constitute interaction with other people and an agreed-on interface between your activities and those of others. Start with a simple appointment diary. List all appointments, including regular and recurring ones. Now, be ruthless and eliminate the unnecessary. There may be committees where you can't productively contribute or where a subordinate may be able to participate. Eliminate the waste of your time.

**Question:**
> Effectively managing your appointments allows you to
> - (A) spend more time with your subordinates
> - (B) delegate responsibility to subordinates
> - **(C) make more efficient use of your time** ✓
> - (D) attend only the most important meetings

**Analysis:** The passage emphasizes eliminating time waste and being efficient. The key phrase is "Eliminate the waste of your time."

### Strategy 2: Find Specific Details

<div style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #ff9800; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #e65100; margin-top: 0;">🟠 Detail Questions</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Look for exact facts stated in the passage. Read carefully - don't infer!</p>
</div>

**Example Passage:**
> The U.S. Congress consists of 100 senators and 435 representatives. Two senators are elected from each state. The number of representatives from each state is based on population, although each state has at least one representative. Senators serve six-year terms, and representatives serve two-year terms.

**Question:**
> According to this passage,
> - (A) there are equal numbers of senators and representatives
> - (B) the number of representatives from each state is decided by a lottery
> - (C) it's possible for a state to have no representatives
> - **(D) senators and representatives have different term lengths** ✓

**Analysis:** The passage explicitly states "Senators serve six-year terms, and representatives serve two-year terms" - different lengths!

---

### Strategy 3: Make Inferences

<div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #4caf50; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #2e7d32; margin-top: 0;">🟢 Inference Questions</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Draw logical conclusions based on what the passage implies (not directly states).</p>
</div>

**Example Passage:**
> Cloud seeding is accomplished by dropping particles of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) from a plane onto super-cooled clouds. This process encourages condensation of water droplets in the clouds, which usually, but not always, results in rain or snow.

**Question:**
> From this passage, it's reasonable to assume that
> - **(A) cloud seeding could be used to end a drought** ✓
> - (B) cloud seeding is prohibitively expensive
> - (C) cloud seeding is rarely used
> - (D) cloud seeding can be accomplished by using regular ice

**Analysis:** If cloud seeding produces rain/snow, it logically could help end droughts. The passage doesn't mention cost or frequency, and specifically says "dry ice" not regular ice.

### Strategy 4: Identify Author's Purpose

<div style="background: #ffebee; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #f44336; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #c62828; margin-top: 0;">🔴 Purpose Questions</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Determine why the author wrote the passage - to inform, persuade, explain, etc.</p>
</div>

**Example Passage:**
> The success or failure of a conference lies largely with its leader. A leader's zest and enthusiasm must be real, apparent, and contagious. The leader is responsible for getting the ball rolling and making the attendees feel as if the meeting is theirs and its success depends on their participation. A good, thorough introduction helps establish the right climate.

**Question:**
> A good title to this paragraph would be
> - (A) "Lead by Example"
> - (B) "The Importance of Proper Introductions"
> - **(C) "Leading a Successful Conference"** ✓
> - (D) "Conference Participation Basics"

**Analysis:** The passage focuses on how a leader makes a conference successful. The main idea is about leadership's role in conference success.

### Strategy 5: Understand Context Clues

<div style="background: #f3e5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #9c27b0; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #7b1fa2; margin-top: 0;">🟣 Context Questions</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Use surrounding words and phrases to understand meaning.</p>
</div>

**Example Passage:**
> I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country and was fed up with it. If people had told me a year ago that I would've been feeling like that I should've laughed at them; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick, I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda water that had been standing in the sun.

**Question:**
> The author is speaking of his travels in
> - (A) Spain
> - **(B) Great Britain** ✓
> - (C) Germany
> - (D) Scotland

**Analysis:** Key clues: "Old Country," "Englishman," "London" - all point to Great Britain/England.

## 📚 Question Types & Examples

### Type 1: Main Idea

<div style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #2196f3; margin: 15px 0;">
  <h3 style="color: #1976d2; margin-top: 0;">🔵 Example</h3>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Passage:</strong> To write or not to write — that is the question. If assigned a writing task, there's no option. However, if someone is looking for a specific answer, find out if they need a short answer or a detailed one. Can the requirement be met with a telephone call, e-mail, or short note, or is something more necessary? A former CEO of a major corporation once commented that he had looked at 13,000 pieces of paper in a 5-day period. Think how much easier and more economical it would be if people would use the telephone, send an e-mail, or write a short note.</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> The main point of this passage is that</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Answer: (C) writing may not be the best way to communicate information</strong> ✓</p>
</div>

  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Passage:</strong> The transistor, a small, solid-state device that can amplify sound, was invented in 1947. At first, it was too expensive and too difficult to produce to be used in cheap, mass-market products. By 1954, though, these cost and production problems had been overcome, and the first transistor radio was put on the market.</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> According to this passage,</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Answer: (B) when transistors could be produced cheaply and easily, the transistor radio was put on the market</strong> ✓</p>
</div>

  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Passage:</strong> Surveys show that the average child under the age of 18 watches four hours of television per day. Although some of the programming may be educational, most isn't. Spending this much time watching television interferes with a child's ability to pursue other interests, such as reading, participating in sports, and playing with friends.</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> The author of this passage would agree that</p>

  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Question:</strong> From the above passage, it is reasonable to assume that</p>
  <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Answer: (A) mock interviews can increase a student's confidence when he or she goes into a real job interview</strong> ✓</p>
</div>
