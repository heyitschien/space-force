Yes — your understanding is **exactly right**, and your uploaded document confirms this strategy is correct for tech/computing roles.

### Short answer:

👉 **Yes. You should focus MOST of your effort on:**

* Arithmetic Reasoning (AR)
* Math Knowledge (MK)
* Word Knowledge (WK)
* Paragraph Comprehension (PC)

…and get **basic competency** on the rest (Electronics, Mechanical, General Science, Auto & Shop).

This is not opinion — this is how the ASVAB scoring system actually works for eligibility and tech roles.

## 🧠 Why these four are the priority (AFQT Core)

From your document:

> **AFQT Score = AR + MK + WK + PC**
> These four sections determine:

* if you qualify to enlist
* and whether you can access higher-skill jobs (including tech/computing roles) 

So if you want to open doors to:

* Cyber Operations
* Computer Systems Support
* Space Systems
* Communications
* Intelligence / Data Systems

You must be strong in:
✅ Arithmetic Reasoning
✅ Math Knowledge
✅ Word Knowledge
✅ Paragraph Comprehension

Especially:

> **Math (AR + MK) is non-negotiable for tech roles.** 

---

## ⚙️ What about the other sections?

These sections matter for **which job** you qualify for, not whether you qualify at all:

* Electronics Information (EI)
* Mechanical Comprehension (MC)
* General Science (GS)
* Auto & Shop (AS)
* Assembling Objects (AO)

Your document says:

> Auto & Shop is lower relevance for tech roles, but still tested
> Electronics Information is high relevance for tech roles
> Mechanical & General Science are moderate relevance 

So the strategy is:

### 🎯 Deep focus:

* AR
* MK
* WK
* PC
* EI (Electronics)

### 📘 Basic familiarity:

* Mechanical
* General Science
* Auto & Shop
* Assembling Objects

Not mastery — just recognition.

## 📊 Think of it like unlocking levels in a game

### Level 1: Can I enter the game?

That’s AFQT (AR + MK + WK + PC).

If this is weak → doors stay closed.

### Level 2: Which character class can I choose?

That’s Electronics, Mechanical, Science, etc.

Higher scores = better technical jobs.

## 🧭 The smartest study distribution (validated)

From your uploaded plan:

**Daily 45 minutes:**

* 20 minutes → AFQT Core (AR/MK or WK/PC)
* 15 minutes → Tech sections (Electronics / Mechanical / Science)
* 10 minutes → Weak areas (Auto & Shop + review) 

This matches exactly what you’re asking:

> Focus hard on priority sections, basic on the rest.

---

## 💡 Why this is the smartest path for YOU

You want:

* computing / tech roles
* stability
* growth
* long-term career

Those roles require:

* logic
* math
* reading comprehension
* problem solving

So your energy should go where it has the highest return.

Not:
❌ memorizing every car part
❌ becoming a mechanic
❌ mastering shop tools

But:
✅ mastering word problems
✅ algebra
✅ reading comprehension
✅ basic electronics

---

## 🏁 Bottom line

Your strategy should be:

> **80% of effort = AFQT Core + Electronics**
> **20% of effort = everything else**

This:

* maximizes your score
* unlocks tech roles
* saves time
* reduces stress
* matches official requirements

And your document confirms this is the correct approach.

If you want, next I can help you create a **very simple priority map** like:

🟢 Must Master
🟡 Must Know
🔵 Nice to Know

for each ASVAB section so you can study with confidence and not feel scattered.

Just say:
**“Make me the priority map.”**
